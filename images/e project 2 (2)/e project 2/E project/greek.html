    <h1>Greek Calligraphy</h1>
    <h4 class="mt-4">The Greek Alphabet</h4>
  <p class="mt-4">In my pursuit to learn Modern Greek, I've had fun playing with the letterforms of this beautiful alphabet. Traditionally, Greeks don't tend to write in script. There is a history of Greek cursive, but the letterforms didn't stick, and cursive isn't taught in schools here. As such, I've been doing a lot of research and experimenting to play with the letterforms and push the bounds. Old Greek signage around Athens has provided lots of inspiration, but I've also played with the glyphs a lot on my own. </p>

      <h1>Greek minuscule</h1>
<p> was a Greek writing style which was developed as a book hand in Byzantine manuscripts during the 9th and 10th centuries.[1] It replaced the earlier style of uncial writing, from which it differed in using smaller, more rounded and more connected letter forms, and in using many ligatures. Many of these forms had previously developed as parts of more informal cursive writing. The basic letter shapes used in the minuscule script are the ancestors of modern lower case Greek letters.

  From the 10th century onwards, most Byzantine manuscripts of classical and early Christian Greek works were gradually rewritten in the new minuscule style, and few of the older uncial manuscripts were preserved. For this reason, uncial manuscripts are today extremely rare, while early minuscule manuscripts are often the oldest preserved sources attesting an ancient work and may therefore be of central importance for its philological study. Manuscripts from the oldest phase of minuscule writing (mid-9th to mid-10th century) are known in scholarship today as codices vetustissimi ("oldest codices"). Those from the mid-10th to the mid-12th centuries are known as codices vetusti ("old codices"), and later ones as codices recentiores ("newer codices").[2]</p>
